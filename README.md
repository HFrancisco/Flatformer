# Flatformer

Flatformer is a 2D platformer type of game. It is similar to the original Mario games that were also 2D. The goal of the player is to reach a certain point so they can proceed to the next level. There are three levels in this game.

The player controls the ball by tilting the phone left or right to move to the left or to the right respectively. Tapping the screen will cause the player to jump. 

The goal is to reach to reach the shorter green platform which is also the right most platform by jumping on the other platforms.

The player should also avoid falling off the base platform which is the longest platform. 

Reaching the shorter green platform will let the player progress to the next level while falling will result in a game over.
